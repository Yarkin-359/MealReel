Week 1
While we were thinking about the project idea, I suggested making an online chess game,
but we did choose the menu application idea. About the menu application idea, I suggested that
the application should be more local and only include restaurants in Ankara to make data
collecting easier for us. 

Week 2
In the first presentation, I did not present any slides, but I helped write
the text of the presentation. After that stage we decided which pages our application should have
and divided those pages between us. I got the search page which searches and filters the
restaurants for the user and the restaurant page which opens after the user selects a restaurant
from the search page. 

Week 3
I designed the Ui for the search page and restaurant page and I presented
these pages in the second presentation. I also did the sitemap for the second presentation. I wrote
the functionalities of the restaurant page and search page in the report. 

Week 4
I coded the Gui for search page and restaurant page using javafx and scene builder. I did the Uml diagram for the
report. 

Week5
I coded all the functionalities for the search page and restaurant page. In the search page
there were functionalities such as making a search, filtering the search, changing the pages
through scroll buttons, and choosing a restaurant from the restaurant list. In the restaurant page
there were functionalities such as adding comments to the restaurant or rating the restaurant.
After that I implemented the MongoDB database to our project. I learned the methods of
MongoDB and use them to store the essential variables in the database such as list of users which
stores the restaurant owners and the customers. Finally, I presented the code part and
the functionalities of the search page and restaurant page in the final presentation.
