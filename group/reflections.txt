Working on this project has helped us better understand how to work not just as individuals but as a group. 
It helped us get better at planing and working with other members in mind which in turn helped our code writing and comments to be more clear and precise.

We faced several difficulties when it came to group work due to our inexperience. 
We had trouble integrating pages since every member had worked individually on their respective workload.

If we could start over again we would take care to communicate more and efficently so that we would face less problems compared to what we did now.

For the implementation part of our project our group members approximately spent around a week.

We believe that although we could have done a better job we still managed to accomplish most of what we set out to do.
